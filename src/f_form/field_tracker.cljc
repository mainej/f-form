  "Tools to help a [[f-form.field]] accumulate history about its value and focus
  state as lifecycle events occur to it.

  The lifecycle events are:

  * `:initialized`, when the field is created or reset.
  * `:snapshot`, when the field's value and initial-value are synced, for example
    when the form has been submitted on a periodic timer. (Also called on
    `:initialized`.)
  * `:focus-gained`, when the field gains focus.
  * `:focus-lost`, when the field loses focus.
  * `:changed`, when the field's value changes.

  The field history is summarized as:

  * `:field/visited?` - whether the field has ever received focus. Typically
    used to mark off complete fields or to call attention to incomplete or pending
    fields.
  * `:field/active?` - whether the field currently has focus. Typically used to
    add an outline or some other emphasis to the focused field, if this cannot be
    done with CSS.
  * `:field/touched?` - whether the field has ever lost focus. Typically used to
    hide errors until the user has failed to take the opportunity to resolve them, or
    to show a âœ“ or some other indicator beside completed fields.
  * `:field/modified?` - whether the field's value has ever been changed (by a
    user action). Typically used to allow the system to control the value of a
    field until the user makes a choice, then to hand control of the value over to
    them.
  * `:field/pristine?` - whether the field's value is the same as its initial
    value. Typically used to skip submission of unchanged fields.

  The names of the history fields were influenced by Final Form
  [FieldState](https://final-form.org/docs/final-form/types/FieldState).

  Since not every application design will care about every state change, and
  since there is a cost to tracking excess state (computationally when
  calculating the state, and in some cases when triggering unnecessary updates
  to a datastore) it is best to skip accumulation of unused state. This
  namespace provides some tools to customize a [[tracker]] that accumulates a
  minimal amount of state.")

(defn tracker
  "Builds a tracker that tracks state for the given `tracking-attrs`, a set of
  some or all of:

  * `:field/visited?`
  * `:field/active?`
  * `:field/touched?`
  * `:field/modified?`
  * `:field/pristine?`

  Most applications will need only one tracker, which can be applied to all
  fields. By default the [[default-tracker]] will be applied."
