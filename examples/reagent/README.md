## Example usage of f-form

This example demonstrates how f-form can be used in a reagent project. See
`src/app/hello_form.cljs`

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
The page will reload if you make edits.

## Other useful scripts

### `yarn server`

Starts a Shadow CLJS background server.<br>
This will speed up starting time for other commands that use Shadow CLJS.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `public` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles all code and optimizes the build for the best performance.

## Acknowledgements

This project was bootstrapped with [Create CLJS
App](https://github.com/filipesilva/create-cljs-app).

The class names used in the CSS styles were influenced by Tailwind CSS. I did
this to demonstrate that f-form does not dictate appearance in any way. The fact
that the styling is ugly is entirely my fault, not Tailwind's.
